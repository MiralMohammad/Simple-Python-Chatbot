# 💬 Simple Python Chatbot

This is a **simple rule-based chatbot** built using Python. It takes user input via the terminal (or Google Colab), matches it to predefined responses, and replies accordingly.

Perfect for beginners who want to learn how chatbots work without using machine learning or external APIs.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The bot listens for user input.
- It compares the input against a dictionary of predefined keywords.
